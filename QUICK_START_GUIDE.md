# 🚀 Expensify Flutter App - Quick Start Guide

## 📱 **What We Have Built**

A **production-ready expense tracking app** with:
- ✅ **Add/Edit Expenses** with categories and dates
- ✅ **Monthly Expense Tracking** with totals and navigation  
- ✅ **Split Expenses Across Months** (core feature - has date bug)
- ✅ **Category Management** with custom colors and icons
- ✅ **Spending Analysis** with charts and insights
- ✅ **Dark/Light Theme** with vibrant Material 3 design
- ✅ **Offline-First Storage** using Hive (no internet required)

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **✅ Working Features:**
- Home screen with monthly expense overview
- Add single expenses with category selection
- Category management (add/edit/delete)
- Analysis screen with spending breakdown
- Theme switching (light/dark/system)
- Date picker with future date support
- Expense editing and deletion

### **🐛 Known Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL**: Split expenses appear on 1st of month instead of preserving original day
2. Hot reload sometimes doesn't apply changes (need full restart)

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Commands**

### **Start Development:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\atula\Expensify\expensify

# Run the app (use this if hot reload isn't working)
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# Check for errors
flutter analyze

# If build issues, clean and restart
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### **Test the App:**
1. **Add Regular Expense**: Home → + → Fill form → Save
2. **Add Split Expense**: Home → + → "Save & Split" → Configure split
3. **Manage Categories**: Categories tab → + → Add new category
4. **View Analysis**: Analysis tab → See spending breakdown
5. **Toggle Theme**: Home → Theme icon (top right)

## 🔧 **Fix Split Date Issue (Priority #1)**

The split feature creates expenses on the 1st of each month instead of preserving the original day.

### **Quick Debug Steps:**
1. **Full Restart**: `flutter run -d emulator-5554` (not hot reload)
2. **Check Files**: Verify changes in `lib/services/split_service.dart` and `lib/screens/split_expense_screen.dart`
3. **Add Debug Logs**: See `DEBUG_SPLIT_ISSUE.md` for detailed debugging steps
4. **Test**: Create split on Aug 31 → Should show Aug 31, Sep 30 (not Aug 1, Sep 1)

### **Files to Check:**
- `lib/services/split_service.dart` - Line ~30: `_calculateSplitDate()` method
- `lib/screens/split_expense_screen.dart` - Line ~448: Preview dialog logic

## 📁 **Key Files Reference**

## 🎯 **Development Workflow**

### **Making Changes:**
1. **Edit Code** using your preferred editor
2. **Hot Reload**: Press `r` in terminal (if app is running)
3. **Full Restart**: Press `R` or `flutter run -d emulator-5554`
4. **Check Errors**: `flutter analyze`
5. **Test Feature** on emulator

### **State Management Pattern:**
```dart

// Refresh UI
ref.invalidate(expensesProvider);
```

### **Adding New Features:**
1. **Update Models** if new data fields needed
2. **Update Services** for business logic
3. **Update Providers** for state management  
4. **Update UI Screens** for user interaction
5. **Test Thoroughly** with various scenarios

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Basic Functionality:**
- [ ] Add expense → appears on home screen
- [ ] Edit expense → changes are saved
- [ ] Delete expense → removed from list
- [ ] Category selection → works in forms
- [ ] Date picker → allows past and future dates
- [ ] Theme toggle → switches between light/dark

### **Split Feature (After Fix):**
- [ ] Split on month-end date → preserves day (Aug 31 → Aug 31, Sep 30)
- [ ] Split on mid-month → preserves day (May 15 → May 15, Jun 15, Jul 15)
- [ ] Split across year boundary → handles correctly (Dec 31 → Dec 31, Jan 31)
- [ ] Preview dialog → shows exact dates and amounts
- [ ] Split expenses → appear in correct months

### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] February 29 (leap year) handling
- [ ] February 31 → February 28/29 conversion
- [ ] April 31 → April 30 conversion
- [ ] Large amounts with rounding
- [ ] Very long category names
- [ ] Special characters in notes
